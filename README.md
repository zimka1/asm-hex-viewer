# Hexadecimal File Viewer (x86 Assembly, MS-DOS)

This is a 16-bit x86 Assembly project written for the MS-DOS environment. The program reads the contents of one or more files and displays them in hexadecimal format. It includes features such as file offset display, multi-file support, pagination with dynamic screen updates, and enhanced user experience with timestamps and file paths.

## Features

* Hexadecimal output of file content (byte-by-byte)
* Offset counter printed at the start of each line
* Supports multiple input files (via command-line)
* Optional pagination with `-p` flag (20 lines per screen)
* Timestamp and full file path shown during pagination
* Handles newline characters and line wrapping
* External procedures for modularity:

  * `print_hex` – prints a byte in hexadecimal
  * `print_date` – prints current date/time
  * `print_dec` – prints offset values in decimal format
* Fully commented in English

## Compilation & Execution Instructions

In MS-DOS or DOSBox:

```asm
1) tasm main.asm      ; Assemble main module
2) tasm hex.asm       ; Assemble print_hex procedure
3) tasm dec.asm       ; Assemble print_dec procedure
4) tasm date.asm      ; Assemble print_date procedure
5) tlink main hex dec date
6) main -h                     ; Show help
7) main -p file1.txt file2.txt ; Paginate multiple files
```

---

## How It Works

* Uses DOS interrupts (`int 21h`) for file I/O and text output
* Reads file contents in 128-byte chunks
* Tracks the file offset to label each hex-dump line
* Every 70 characters or 20 lines, inserts a page break
* With `-p`, displays timestamp and file path before continuing

---

## Command-Line Usage

```dos
main [-h] [-p] <file1> [file2] [...]
```

* `-h`     – Show help message
* `-p`     – Enable pagination
* `<file>` – One or more file names to display

Example:

```dos
main -p data1.txt data2.txt
```

## Testing Notes

Tested with:

* Empty files
* Files larger than 64 KB (offset wraps due to 16-bit counter)
* Long file paths
* Missing files or permission issues (error handler triggered)

---

## Known Limitations

* Cannot process files over 64 KB without offset overflow
* Terminal width fixed to 70 characters
* Only ASCII-compatible input is properly rendered

---

## Possible Enhancements

* Use extended memory (XMS/EMS) for larger files
* Implement keyboard navigation (next/prev page)
* Add binary and ASCII views alongside hexadecimal
* Allow filtering or highlighting bytes
